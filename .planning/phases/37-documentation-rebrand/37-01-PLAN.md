<objective>
Rebrand CocoSearch README from "semantic code search" to reflect its complete v1.8 feature set: hybrid search, 10-language symbol support, stats dashboard observability.

Purpose: Update positioning to match actual capabilities, improve discoverability of v1.8 features, and meet Documentation Rebrand phase success criteria.

Output: Updated README.md with new tagline, reorganized structure, language tiering, observability section, and contributing guide.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Restructure README top sections and ordering</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite the top sections of README.md following this structure:

1. **New Tagline** (replace current "Local-first semantic code search via MCP"):
```markdown
# CocoSearch

Hybrid search for codebases — semantic understanding meets keyword precision.

Search your code with natural language, filter by symbols, expand context. Works as CLI or MCP server. Everything runs locally.
```

2. **Move Quick Start immediately after tagline** (before "What CocoSearch Does"):
- Keep existing Quick Start content (Docker-based, 5 minutes)
- Update any references to position as first action after intro

3. **Reorder sections** to follow this flow:
```
1. Title + Tagline (new)
2. Quick Start (5 minutes) — moved up
3. What CocoSearch Does — keep existing, update to reflect hybrid search
4. Architecture — keep existing Mermaid diagram
5. Table of Contents — update to reflect new sections
[Rest of document follows]
```

4. **Update Table of Contents** to include:
- New "Observability" section (after Search Features)
- New "Contributing" section (after Configuration)
- Remove Troubleshooting from prominent position (will move to end in Task 2)

5. **Update "What CocoSearch Does" section** to lead with hybrid search:
```markdown
## What CocoSearch Does

CocoSearch indexes your code and enables hybrid search — combining semantic understanding with keyword precision. All processing happens on your machine.

- **Hybrid search** — semantic similarity + keyword matching via RRF fusion
- **Symbol filtering** — filter by function, class, method, or symbol name patterns
- **Context expansion** — smart expansion to enclosing function/class boundaries
- **Index observability** — stats dashboard for monitoring index health
- **Stay private** — everything runs locally, no external API calls
- **Use with AI assistants** — integrate via CLI or MCP (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, OpenCode)
```

Tone: Friendly and approachable, as specified in CONTEXT.md.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `head -20 README.md` shows new tagline with "Hybrid search for codebases"
- `grep -n "Quick Start" README.md | head -1` shows Quick Start appears before "What CocoSearch Does"
- `grep -n "Table of Contents" README.md` shows ToC exists and includes Observability
  </verify>
  <done>
- README tagline says "Hybrid search for codebases — semantic understanding meets keyword precision"
- Quick Start section is first major section after tagline
- Table of Contents updated with new section references
- "What CocoSearch Does" leads with hybrid search capabilities
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add Observability, Contributing sections and update Language tiering</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Add new sections and update existing content:

1. **Add Observability section** (after Search Features, before Supported Languages):

```markdown
## Observability

Monitor index health, language distribution, and symbol breakdown.

### Index Statistics

```bash
cocosearch stats myproject --pretty
```

Output shows file count, chunk count, size, and staleness warnings:

```
    Index: myproject
┏━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Metric  ┃ Value       ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ Files   │ 68          │
│ Chunks  │ 488         │
│ Size    │ 2.1 MB      │
│ Updated │ 2 days ago  │
└─────────┴─────────────┘
```

### Language Breakdown

View per-language file counts, chunk distribution, and line counts:

```bash
cocosearch stats myproject --pretty
```

```
           Language Statistics
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Language   ┃ Files ┃ Chunks ┃  Lines ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━┩
│ python     │    42 │    287 │  3,521 │
│ typescript │    18 │    156 │  2,103 │
│ markdown   │     5 │     32 │    654 │
├────────────┼───────┼────────┼────────┤
│ TOTAL      │    68 │    488 │  6,516 │
└────────────┴───────┴────────┴────────┘
```

### Dashboard

Web-based stats visualization:

```bash
cocosearch serve-dashboard
# Opens browser to http://localhost:8080
```

The dashboard displays real-time index health with language distribution charts.

### JSON Output

Machine-readable stats for automation:

```bash
cocosearch stats myproject --json
```

[↑ Back to top](#table-of-contents)
```

2. **Update Supported Languages section** with explicit tiering:

Replace the current language section with:

```markdown
## Supported Languages

CocoSearch indexes 31 programming languages via Tree-sitter. Symbol extraction (for `--symbol-type` and `--symbol-name` filtering) is available for 10 languages.

### Full Support (Symbol-Aware)

**Python**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Go**, **Rust**, **Java**, **C**, **C++**, **Ruby**, **PHP**

All features: Hybrid search, symbol filtering, smart context expansion

Symbol types extracted: `function`, `class`, `method`, `interface`

### Basic Support

C#, CSS, Fortran, HTML, JSON, Kotlin, Markdown, Pascal, R, Scala, Shell, Solidity, SQL, Swift, TOML, XML, YAML, Bash, Dockerfile, HCL, and more

Features: Hybrid search, semantic + keyword search

View all supported extensions:

```bash
cocosearch languages
```

[↑ Back to top](#table-of-contents)
```

Note: RESEARCH.md says 5 symbol-aware languages (Python, JS, TS, Go, Rust), but Phase 34 added Java, C, C++, Ruby, PHP — verify with `cocosearch languages` output. Use actual current count.

3. **Add Contributing section** (after Configuration):

```markdown
## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! CocoSearch is open source under AGPL-3.0.

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VioletCranberry/coco-s.git

```

4. **Move Troubleshooting to end** (after Contributing, before any footer):
- Move the existing "Troubleshooting Docker" section to the very end of the document
- Keep content intact, just reposition

5. **Update MCP section titles** to frame CLI and MCP as equals:
- Ensure "CLI Reference" and "Configuring MCP" are at same heading level
- Both should appear in Table of Contents with equal prominence
  </action>
  <verify>
- `grep -n "## Observability" README.md` shows Observability section exists
- `grep -n "Full Support" README.md` shows language tiering
- `grep -n "## Contributing" README.md` shows Contributing section exists
- `grep -n "## Troubleshooting" README.md` shows it's near end of file (line number > 900)
  </verify>
  <done>
- Observability section exists with stats examples, language breakdown, and dashboard command
- Languages tiered as "Full Support (Symbol-Aware)" and "Basic Support"
- Contributing section exists with setup instructions and PR guidance
- Troubleshooting moved to end of document (de-emphasized per CONTEXT)
- MCP and CLI have equal prominence in structure
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

Overall phase verification:

1. **Tagline check:**
   ```bash
   head -10 README.md | grep -i "hybrid search"
   ```
   Expected: "Hybrid search for codebases" in first 10 lines

2. **Section order check:**
   ```bash
   grep -n "^## " README.md | head -10
   ```
   Expected order: Quick Start, What CocoSearch Does, Architecture, Table of Contents...

3. **Feature completeness:**
   ```bash
   grep -c "Observability\|Full Support\|Contributing" README.md
   ```
   Expected: All three patterns found

4. **Success criteria verification:**
   - [ ] README positions CocoSearch as hybrid search + symbol filtering + context expansion tool
   - [ ] README accurately describes v1.8 features (caching via query cache, 10-language symbols, stats dashboard)
   - [ ] Feature overview matches current capabilities
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Quick Start is first section after tagline/description
- Observability section exists with CLI stats and dashboard examples
- Languages explicitly tiered (Full Support: 10 symbol-aware, Basic Support: 21+ others)
- Contributing section exists with setup and PR guidance
- Troubleshooting moved to end (de-emphasized)
- MCP and CLI presented as equal citizens throughout
