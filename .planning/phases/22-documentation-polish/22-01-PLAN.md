<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Restructure README with comprehensive TOC</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Reorganize README.md following the user's decisions from CONTEXT.md:

**Step 1: Reorder sections for user journey flow**
New section order (with action-oriented headings):
1. Title + brief intro (keep as-is)
2. What CocoSearch Does (keep)
3. Architecture (keep)
4. Table of Contents (comprehensive, emoji-prefixed)
5. Installing (rename from "Installation")
   - Installing Ollama (from "1. Install Ollama")
   - Starting PostgreSQL (from "2. Start PostgreSQL with pgvector")
   - Installing CocoSearch (from "3. Install CocoSearch")
6. Getting Started (rename from "Quick Start")
   - Indexing Your Code (from "Index Your Code")
   - Searching Semantically (from "Search Semantically")
   - Using with MCP (from "Use with MCP")
7. Dogfooding (rename from "Searching CocoSearch")
   - Prerequisites (keep)
   - Indexing the Codebase (keep)
   - Verifying Indexing (from "Verify Indexing")
   - Example Searches (keep)
   - Full Development Environment (from "Need Full Development Environment?")
8. Configuring MCP (rename from "MCP Configuration")
   - Configuring Claude Code (from "Claude Code")
   - Configuring Claude Desktop (from "Claude Desktop")
   - Configuring OpenCode (from "OpenCode")
9. CLI Reference (keep)
   - Indexing Commands (from "Indexing")
   - Searching Commands (from "Searching")
   - Managing Indexes (keep)
10. Configuration (keep as "Configuring CocoSearch" or keep "Configuration")
    - Configuration File (from ".cocosearch.yaml")
    - Environment Variables (keep)

**Step 2: Create comprehensive TOC with emojis**
Format:
```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [What CocoSearch Does](#what-cocosearch-does)
- [Architecture](#architecture)
- [Installing](#installing)
  - [Installing Ollama](#installing-ollama)
  - [Starting PostgreSQL](#starting-postgresql)
  - [Installing CocoSearch](#installing-cocosearch)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
  - [Indexing Your Code](#indexing-your-code)
  - [Searching Semantically](#searching-semantically)
  - [Using with MCP](#using-with-mcp)
... (all sections)
```

Add unique, fitting emoji prefix to each top-level section (Claude's discretion on which emojis).

**Step 3: Add back-to-top links**
After each major section (Installing, Getting Started, Dogfooding, Configuring MCP, CLI Reference, Configuration), add:
```markdown
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)
```

**Rules:**
- Use 2-space indentation for nested TOC items
- Standard markdown anchor links: `[Section Name](#section-name)`
- No numbering in TOC
- No collapsible container for TOC
- Keep all existing content, just reorganize structure
- Preserve all code examples exactly as they are
- Anchors must match heading text (lowercase, spaces to hyphens)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Open README.md in VS Code or GitHub preview
2. Click each TOC link - verify it jumps to correct section
3. Verify TOC has emoji prefixes on top-level sections
4. Verify back-to-top links appear after major sections
5. Verify section order follows user journey: overview -> install -> quick start -> config -> advanced
6. Run: `grep -c "^## " README.md` to count major sections
7. Count TOC top-level entries - should match section count
  </verify>
  <done>
- README has comprehensive TOC with all sections and subsections
- Each top-level TOC entry has emoji prefix
- Sections reorganized for user journey flow
- Headings use action-oriented style
- Back-to-top links present after major sections
- All TOC links are clickable and jump to correct anchors
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completing the task:
1. **TOC completeness:** Every H2 and H3 heading appears in TOC
2. **Link functionality:** All TOC links work (test in GitHub preview or markdown viewer)
3. **Emoji presence:** Each top-level TOC entry has emoji prefix
4. **Section order:** Sections follow user journey: overview -> install -> quick start -> config -> advanced
5. **Back-to-top:** Major sections end with back-to-top link
6. **Content preserved:** All original content still present (no content deleted)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] README.md has comprehensive Table of Contents
- [ ] TOC covers all H2 and H3 sections
- [ ] Top-level TOC entries have emoji prefixes
- [ ] Sections reordered for user journey flow
- [ ] Headings use action-oriented style where applicable
- [ ] Back-to-top links after major sections
- [ ] All TOC links are valid markdown anchors
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/22-documentation-polish/22-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
