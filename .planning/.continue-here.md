<current_state>
Defining v1.8 Polish & Observability milestone. Research phase COMPLETE, about to start requirements definition.

Workflow position: /gsd:new-milestone → Phase 7 (Research) ✓ → Phase 8 (Define Requirements) ← NEXT
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- PROJECT.md updated with v1.8 milestone goals
- STATE.md reset for new milestone
- Committed: "docs: start milestone v1.8 Polish & Observability"
- Research completed with 4 parallel agents:
  - STACK.md: FastAPI/Uvicorn for stats, tree-sitter-language-pack migration, PostgreSQL JSONB for caching
  - FEATURES_v1.8.md: Table stakes vs differentiators for dashboard, skills, caching, symbols
  - ARCHITECTURE.md: Integration points, build order, component changes
  - PITFALLS.md: Performance overhead, C/C++ parsing issues, cache invalidation, docs fragmentation
- SUMMARY.md synthesized and committed (f0d5128)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

In /gsd:new-milestone workflow:
- Phase 8: Define Requirements — scope features from research, create REQUIREMENTS.md
- Phase 9: Create Roadmap — spawn gsd-roadmapper, generate phases 33+
- Phase 10: Done — present next steps

Then ready for /gsd:plan-phase [33]
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Version: v1.8 (incremental, not v2.0)
- Stats panel: All three interfaces (HTTP API + terminal + web UI)
- Skills scope: Installation + routing (not full integration)
- Symbol coverage: Top 10 languages (add Java, C, C++, Ruby, PHP)
- Research: Completed (user chose "Research first")
</decisions_made>

None — ready to proceed with requirements definition.

<context>
User's v1.8 vision:
1. Deferred v1.7 features (hybrid+symbol combo, nested symbols, query caching)
2. Symbol extraction for 5 more languages (10 total)
3. Stats dashboard with HTTP API, terminal dashboard, and web UI
4. Claude Code + OpenCode skills for installation and code exploration routing
5. Documentation overhaul (README rebrand, retrieval logic, MCP tools, personal endorsement)

Research recommends 5 phases:
1. Deferred v1.7 Foundation (caching, hybrid+symbol, nested symbols)
2. Symbol Extraction Expansion (5 new languages, .scm query files)
3. Stats Dashboard (async collection, FastAPI)
4. Developer Skills (skill discovery, CLI commands)
5. Documentation Overhaul (after features stable)

Key stack additions: FastAPI/Uvicorn (optional), tree-sitter-language-pack (migration), PostgreSQL JSONB (caching)

<next_action>
Resume with: /gsd:resume-work

This will continue the /gsd:new-milestone workflow at Phase 8 (Define Requirements):
1. Present features by category from FEATURES_v1.8.md
2. Scope each category with user (multiSelect which features in v1.8)
3. Generate REQUIREMENTS.md with REQ-IDs
4. Then proceed to roadmap creation (Phase 9)
